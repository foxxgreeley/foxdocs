## What is N + 1?
In short, it's when Laravel code runs too many database queries. 
It happens because Eloquent allows developers to write a readable syntax with models, without digging deeper into what "magic" is happening under the hood.

This is a problem because it results in a large number of queries being executed against the database.

### The Problem
For example, let's say we have a `Book` model 

```php
$books = Book::all();
 
foreach ($books as $book) {
    echo $book->author->name;
}
```
In this example, we are retrieving all the books from the database and then looping over them to access the author relationship.

But, if you have 100 books on the list, you will have 101 queries to the DB. Awful performance, although the code seemed innocent.
    
### The Solution
The solution to the N + 1 problem is to eager load the relationship when retrieving the models from the database.
This will result in a single query being executed to retrieve all the related models.

```php
// Instead of:
$books = Book::all();
 
// You should do:
$books = Book::with('author')->get();
```
## Diagnosing the Problem

To help identify N + 1 problems, you can listen to the route queries are executed on using the `DB::listen` method.
This method accepts a closure that will be called with the query and bindings when a query is executed.

```php
DB::listen(function ($query) {
    logger($query->sql, $query->bindings);
});
```

This log file will be in `storage/logs/laravel.log`.
