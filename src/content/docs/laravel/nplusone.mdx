title: The N + 1 Problem
description: When working with databases in Laravel, you will often come across the N + 1 problem.
sidebar:
  order: 7

## The Problem 
This is where you have a query that returns a collection of models, and then you loop over the collection and perform a query for each model. 
This is a problem because it results in a large number of queries being executed against the database.

For example, let's say we have a `User` model that has many `Post` models.
    
```php
class User extends Model
{
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    }
}
```

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
}
```

```php
$users = User::all();

foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->posts->count();
}
```

In this example, we are retrieving all users from the database, and then looping over the collection and accessing the `posts` relationship.
This will result in a query being executed for each user to retrieve the related posts.

### Listening to Queries

To help identify N + 1 problems, you can listen to the route queries are executed on using the `DB::listen` method.
This method accepts a closure that will be called with the query and bindings when a query is executed.

```php
DB::listen(function ($query) {
    logger($query->sql, $query->bindings);
});
```

This log file will be in `storage/logs/laravel.log`.

## The Solution

### Eager Loading

The solution to the N + 1 problem is to eager load the relationship when retrieving the models from the database.
This will result in a single query being executed to retrieve all the related models.

```php
Route::get('blog', function () {

    return view('blog', [
        // Order the posts by the published_at column in descending order
        'posts' => Post::latest('published_at')->with('category', 'author')->get()
    ]);

});

```
