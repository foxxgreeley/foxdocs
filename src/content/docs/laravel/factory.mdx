## Basic Concepts
Factories are located in the `database/factories` directory. They provide a convenient way to generate random data for your models and database.

Seeders are good for creating a lot of data, but what do you do if you need to seed non-default data? For example, you may need to seed a user with a specific role, or a post with a specific status. 
This is where factories come in.

### Creating Factories

Factories can be made with the following command:
```bash
php artisan make:factory PostFactory
```
or when making a model:
```bash
php artisan make:model Post -f
```

### Using Factories
Then you can provide all of the fields you want to be filled in the factory and
methods to generate random data for them. For example:
```php

use App\Post;
use Faker\Generator as Faker;

$factory->define(Post::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'title' => $faker->sentence,
        'body' => $faker->paragraph,
        'published' => $faker->boolean,
    ];
});
```

Then you can use the factory in your seeders:
```php
factory(Post::class, 50)->create();
```

This will make 50 posts with random data.
