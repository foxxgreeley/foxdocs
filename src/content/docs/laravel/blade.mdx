## What is Blade?
Blade makes templating easier and works similarly to Vue 3
in terms of syntax.

For example:

```php
// Without Blade
<?php echo $name; ?>

// With Blade
{{ $name }}
```
Note: This can only be achieved with .blade.php files.

Blade files compile to plain PHP code and are cached until they are modified, meaning Blade adds essentially zero overhead to your application. Blade view files use the `.blade.php` file extension and are typically stored in the `resources/views` directory.

### Directives
Blade uses directives instead of PHP control structures to make it easier to write your views. All Blade directives start with the `@` symbol.


```php
@if (count($records) === 1)
    I have one record!
@elseif (count($records) > 1)
    I have multiple records!
@else
    I don't have any records!
@endif
```

### HTML Escaping
If you want to have your variable rendered as HTML instead of as
a string, you can use the `{!! !!}` syntax.

```php
{!! $name !!}
```

>There is a <b>downside</b> to this, however. If you are using user input, you should be careful as this can lead to XSS attacks.
>
> For instance, a user could have a post title as `<script>alert('hello')</script>`. If you were to use the `{!! !!}` syntax, the script would be executed.
