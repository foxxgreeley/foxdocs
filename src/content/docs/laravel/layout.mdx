## What are Layouts?
Layouts in Laravel can be used to wrap your app with a common template. This is useful for having a common header and footer across all pages.

It also comes in handy for fonts, stylesheets, and scripts that you want to include on every page.

## Creating a Layout
To create a layout, create a component file in the `resources/views/components` directory. Any component file in this directory will be automatically registered with Laravel.

For example, if you want to create a layout called `app`, create a file called `app.blade.php` in the `resources/views/components` directory.
```html
// resources/views/components/app.blade.php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Blog</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/app.css">
    <script src="/app.js"></script>
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap"
        rel="stylesheet">
</head>

<body class="font-sans antialiased">

    {{ $slot }}

</body>

</html>

```

### Components
To make something slotable, you will need to wrap it in `<x-layout>` tags. For example, if you want to make a page called `home`, create a file called `home.blade.php` in the `resources/views` directory.
```html
<x-layout>
    <h1>Home</h1>
</x-layout>
```

### Props
You can pass props to components and layouts. For example, if you want to pass a prop called `post` 
to a component called `single-post`, create a file called `single-post.blade.php` in the `resources/views/components` directory.
```html
// resources/views/components/single-post.blade.php
// This is the prop is being recieved
@props(['post']) 

<div class="single-post-container">
    <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>
    <div> {{ $post->body }} </div>
</div>
```

Then, in the file where you are using the component, you can pass the prop like this:
```html
// resources/views/home.blade.php
// this is where the prop is being passed
<x-single-post :post="$post" />
```

### Partials
You can also use layouts to create partials. For example, if you want to create a partial called `header`, create a file called `header.blade.php` in the `resources/views/components` directory.
```html
<header>
    <h1>My Blog</h1>
</header>
```

Partials are good for things like hero sections, navigation bars, and footers.

### Loops
You can also use layouts to create loops. For example, if you want to create a loop called `posts`, create a file called `posts.blade.php` in the `resources/views/components` directory.
```html
@foreach ($posts as $post)
    <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>
@endforeach
```

You can even check the iteration count and style based on that.
```html
@foreach ($posts as $post)
    @if ($loop->even)
        <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>
    @else
        <h2>{{ $post->title }}</h2>
    @endif
@endforeach
```

## Time Conversion
You can also use layouts to convert time. For example, if you want to create a time converter called
 `time`, create a file called `time.blade.php` in the `resources/views/components` directory. This uses
 the carbon library to convert the time.
```html
{{ $time->diffForHumans() }}
```
