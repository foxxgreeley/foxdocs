## Structure
Layouts in Laravel can be used to wrap your app with a common template. This is useful for having a common header and footer across all pages.

It also comes in handy for fonts, stylesheets, and scripts that you want to include on every page.

## Layouts
To create a layout, create a component file in the `resources/views/components` directory. Any component file in this directory will be automatically registered with Laravel.

For example, if you want to create a layout called `app`, create a file called `app.blade.php` in the `resources/views/components` directory.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Blog</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/app.css">
    <script src="/app.js"></script>
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap"
        rel="stylesheet">
</head>

<body class="font-sans antialiased">

    {{ $slot }}

</body>

</html>

```

## Blade Components
To make something slotable, you will need to wrap it in `<x-layout>` tags. For example, if you want to make a page called `home`, create a file called `home.blade.php` in the `resources/views` directory.
```html
<x-layout>
    <h1>Home</h1>
</x-layout>
```
