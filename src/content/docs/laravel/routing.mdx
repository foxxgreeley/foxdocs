The Routes folder is located in the `/routes` directory. This folder contains all the routes for your application. The most basic Laravel routes accept a URI and a closure, providing a very simple and expressive method of defining routes and behavior without complicated routing configuration files.

## Basic Routing
All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are located in the routes directory. These files are automatically loaded by your application's `App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider`. 

The most basic routes are defined in the `/routes/web.php` file. 
The routes defined in `web.php` are typically for the web interface of your application. These routes are assigned the `web` middleware group, which provides features like session state and CSRF protection.

```php
// Create a route that returns a view, in this case it's called welcome.blade.php
// Located in /resources/views/welcome.blade.php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

```php
// web.php

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

## View Routes
If your route only needs to return a view, you may use the Route::view method. This method provides a simple shortcut so that you do not have to define a full route or controller. 

The view method accepts a URI as its first argument and a view name as its second argument.
In addition, you may provide an array of data to pass to the view as an optional third argument:
```php
Route::view('/welcome', 'welcome');
 
Route::view('/welcome', 'welcome', ['name' => 'Taylor']);

```
## API Routing

The `routes/api.php` file defines routes for API, which are stateless and are assigned the `api` middleware group.

```php
// Create a route that returns a JSON response
Route::get('/api', function () {
    return response()->json(['name' => 'Abigail', 'state' => 'CA']);
});
```

## Dynamic Routing
Routes can use wildcards and variable queries to dynamically return HTML or other views.
The example code below will get the slug (wildcard) and find a matching HTML file to return at the dynamic route.

```php
Route::get('blog/posts/{post}', function ($slug) {

    // Get the contents of the post
    $path = __DIR__ . "/../resources/posts/{$slug}.html";

    // Error handling
    if (! file_exists($path)) {
        return redirect('blog');
    }

    // Cache the post for 10 minutes (600 seconds)
    $post = cache()->remember("posts.{$slug}", 600, function () use ($path) {
        return file_get_contents($path);
    });
    // The benefit of caching is that the file is only read once and then stored in memory
    // for the duration of the cache. This is much faster than reading the file every time.

    // Return the view and pass in the post
    return view('post', [
        'post' => $post
    ]);
}) -> where('post', '[A-z_\-]+');
    // applies a constraint to the route parameter using Regex
    // [A-z_\-]+ means that the parameter must be one or more letters, underscores or hyphens.
```

## Available Router Methods
The router allows you to register routes that respond to any HTTP verb:

```php
Route::get($uri, $callback);
Route::post($uri, $callback);
Route::put($uri, $callback);
Route::patch($uri, $callback);
Route::delete($uri, $callback);
Route::options($uri, $callback);
```

## Route Naming 
You may also specify names for routes. These names can be used to conveniently generate URLs or redirects to specific routes. 

They can also be used to check if a user is currently on a given route. See below for an example of this.

```php
Route::get('user/profile', function () {
    //
}) -> name('profile');
```
and then in a view you can use the route helper to generate a URL to that route:
```php
<a href="{{ route('profile') }}">Profile</a>
```
## Controller Routing
You can use a controller like `PostsController` to handle your routes. 
```php
Route::get('blog', [PostController::class, 'index'])->name('blog');
```
while your `PostController` would look like this:
```php
class PostController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return view('blog.index');
    }
}
```
This is a good way to keep all route logic in one place and keep your routes file clean.
