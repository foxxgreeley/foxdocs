## About Models
Models are typically stored in the `app/Models` directory.

Eloquent models are typically created using Artisan's `make:model` command. This command will create a model stub class in the `app/Models` directory.

### Creating a Model
To create a model, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
php artisan make:model Models/ModelName
```
This will create a new model in the `app/Models` directory.

### Defining a Model
A model is a class that extends the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` class.
```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class ModelName extends Model
{
    // 
}
```

## Structure
Below is an example of a model with all of its properties and methods.
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable;

    /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'email',
        'password',
    ];

    /**
     * The attributes that should be hidden for serialization.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
     */
    protected $hidden = [
        'password',
        'remember_token',
    ];

    /**
     * The attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @var array<string, string>
     */
    protected $casts = [
        'email_verified_at' => 'datetime',
        'password' => 'hashed',
    ];
}
```
## Foreign Keys
Foreign keys are used to link two tables together. 
For example, a `users` table may have a `role_id` column that references the `id` column in the `roles` table. This is a one-to-many relationship, where a user can only have one role, but a role can have many users.
