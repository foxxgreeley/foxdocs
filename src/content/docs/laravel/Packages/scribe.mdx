Scribe helps you generate API documentation for humans from your Laravel/Lumen/Dingo codebase.


## Installation
To install Scribe, run:

```bash
sail composer require --dev knuckleswtf/scribe
```

This will install Scribe and all required dependencies. Scribe will automatically register itself using Laravel's package discovery.

## Configuration
To publish Scribe's configuration file, run:

```bash
sail artisan vendor:publish --tag=scribe-config
```
This will create a scribe.php file in your config folder.

## Generating API Docs
To generate API docs in a project with Scribe installed, run:

```bash
sail artisan scribe:generate
```

This will run or rerun the API documentation generation process. The generated docs will be saved in `public/docs`.
