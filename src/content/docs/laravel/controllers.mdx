## Controller Routing
You can use a controller like `PostsController` to handle your routes. 
```php
// /routes/web.php
Route::get('blog', [PostController::class, 'index'])->name('blog');
```
while your `PostController` would look like this:
```php
// app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php
class PostController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return view('blog.index');
    }
}
```
This is a good way to keep all route logic in one place and keep your routes file clean.
