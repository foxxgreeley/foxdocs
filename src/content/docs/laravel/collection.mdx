## What are Collections?
The `Illuminate\Support\Collection` class provides a fluent, convenient wrapper for working with arrays of data.

### Creating Collections
You may create a collection by passing an array to the `collect` helper function. The `collect` function returns an instance of the `Illuminate\Support\Collection` class:

```php
$collection = collect([1, 2, 3]);
```
### Methods
This allows you to use helpful Laravel collection methods like `map` and `filter`:

```php
$filtered = $collection->filter(function ($value, $key) {
    return $value > 2;
});

$filtered->all();

// [3]
```
There are dozens of methods available to you when working with collections, including several common methods that are also available on PHP arrays. 
Below is a link to the Laravel documentation on collections, which includes all of the available methods:
