## Laravel Sail
Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker development environment. 
Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience.

## Installation & Setup
Before we create a new Laravel application on your Windows machine, make sure to install Docker Desktop. 
Next, you should ensure that Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is installed and enabled. 


### New Projects
Run the following command to start a new Laravel project:

```bash
curl -s https://laravel.build/example-app | bash
```
After the project has been created, you can navigate to the application directory and start Laravel Sail.

```bash
cd example-app

./vendor/bin/sail up
```
### Existing Projects
If you already have a Laravel project that you would like to add Docker support to, you may install Laravel Sail using Composer:

```bash
composer require laravel/sail --dev

php artisan sail:install

./vendor/bin/sail up
```

## Aliases
Nobody wants to get stuck writing `./vendor/bin/sail` over and over again. Let's fix that by adding some aliases to our `.bashrc` file.

```bash
alias sail='bash vendor/bin/sail'
```

Now you can run `sail` commands from anywhere in your terminal. ( e.g `sail up` to start your containers)
