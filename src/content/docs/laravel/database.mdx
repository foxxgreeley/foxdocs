## Defining Connections
The configuration for Laravel's database services is located in your application's `config/database.php` configuration file.

I would recommend using HeidiSQL to manage your database connections.

## Using Sail with Docker Desktop
To use artisan commands to interact with your database, you
will need to use `sail` to run the commands. For example:

```bash
sail artisan migrate
```
instead of:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```
## Configuration Format
When using docker, the easiest connection for mysql is usually similar to below:
```php
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=starter
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
FORWARD_DB_PORT=3306

```

## Default Tables
The default tables for Laravel are as follows:

```php
failed_jobs
migrations
password_reset_tokens
personal_access_tokens
users
```

## Rolling Back Migrations
If you need to rollback your migrations, you can use the following command:

```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

## Adding a database entry
If you wanted to add a new User to the database, you would do the following artisan
command:
```bash
sail  artisan tinker
```
This will open up a PHP shell. In the below code, you will configure each table cell corresponding to the model with a new entry.

From here, you can run the following commands to add a new user entry to the database:
```php
// Each of these lines will fill a field/cell
$user = new App\Models\User;
$user->name = 'John Doe';
$user->email = 'john.doe@gmail.com'
$user->password = bcrypt('password'); // Hashed

$user->save(); // This will save the user to the database.
```
This will create a new user in the database.
Note the `bcrypt` function. This is a Laravel helper function that hashes the password and prevents it from being stored as a string.

## Finding a database entry
If you wanted to find a user in the database, you can run the following tinker command:
```php
User::find(1);
```
This will find the user with the ID of 1 and print all relevant information:

```php
pp\Models\User {#7220
    id: 1,
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "johndoe@gmail.com",
    email_verified_at: null,
    #password: "$2y$10$NlVcY1FP/SffipC2tX/tve7nqWHALxs9fKnC2tGoHxbvEVb/CSJGW",
    #remember_token: null,
    created_at: "2023-10-23 04:39:03",
    updated_at: "2023-10-23 04:39:03",
  }
```

Similarly, if you wanted all users, you can run the following command:
```php
User::all(); // This will return all users in the database.
```

## Making a migration for a model
If you wanted to create a migration for a model, you can run the following command:
```bash
sail artisan make:migration create_posts_table
```
This will create a migration file in the `database/migrations` folder. 
The `database/migrations` folder is where all migrations (databases) are stored.

## Modifying a new table
If you wanted to modify a new table, you can edit it's file in `database/migrations`.

Here is an example:
```php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     */
    public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('title');
            $table->text('excerpt');
            $table->text('body');
            $table->timestamps();
            $table->timestamp('published_at')->nullable();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     */
    public function down(): void
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('posts');
    }
};
    
    ```

    In this example, we are creating a new table called `posts` . This table has the following columns:
    - id
    - title
    - excerpt
    - body
    - timestamps
    - published_at (nullable)

    Nullable means that the column can be null. In this case, the published_at column can be null.

## Updating existing tables
If you wanted to update an existing table, you can rerun tinker and run the following command:
```php
User::find(1)->update(['name' => 'Jane Doe']);
```
This will update the name of the user with the ID of 1 to Jane Doe.
