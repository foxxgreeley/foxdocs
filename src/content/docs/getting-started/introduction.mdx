## About the website
Foxdocs is built using Astro, a static site generator for building lightning-fast websites with minimal JS. This site runs on the Starlight package - which is a custom theme by Astro.

This site is built with TailwindCSS in mind and all content is written in Markdown. Vercel is used for hosting and deployment as this project is primarily a learning experience andn not intended for production use.
